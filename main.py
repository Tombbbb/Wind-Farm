""" Machine Learning to optimise wind turbine placements in a wind farm

Creates a Gaucian Mixture Model for existing wind data for a wind farm in La Haute Borne
Uses the wake model and the GMM to generate expected power output for a given wind farm layout
Uses Multi-Objective Optinisation to find pareto front of wind farm layouts
